Agent
=====

An Agent is a description of capabilities, characteristics and behaviors of an entity in a simulation.
The instantiation of an agent is called an **AgentInstance**, and it is the actual entity that interacts with the simulation.
The actual individual entities can be created from the agent description.
Each AgentInstance has its own state, and can interact with other AgentInstances of different Agents in the simulation.
AgentInstances are created by locators.

Examples of the characteristics of an agent are:

- **Body**: The physical representation of the agent.
- **Brain**: How the agent makes decisions.
